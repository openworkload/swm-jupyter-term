Sky Port Terminal for JupyterLab
===============================

# Sky Port project

Sky Port is an universal bus between user software and compute resources.
It can also be considered as a transportation layer between workload producers
and compute resource providers. Sky Port makes it easy to connect user software
to different cloud resources.

# Sky Port JupyterLab integration

The current project consists of two components:

* [JupyterLab extension](https://github.com/skyworkflows/swm-jupyter-term/tree/master/extension)
* [Jupyter Spawner](https://github.com/skyworkflows/swm-jupyter-term/tree/master/spawner)
