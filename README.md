Sky Port Juputer terminal
=============================

# Overview

Sky Port is an universal bus between user software and compute resources.
It can also be considered as a transportation layer between workload producers and compute resource providers.
Sky Port makes it easy to connect user software to different cloud resources.

# JupyterHub integration

The project in this repository represents a custom spawner that allows spawning jupyterlab server over Sky Port.
The spawner python package is distributed via PyPI: [swmjupyter](https://pypi.org/project/swmjupyter).

## How to run

1. Ensure configurable-http-proxy is installed:
```bash
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g configurable-http-proxy
```

2. Install jupyterhub and swmjupyter in virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/jupyterhub
source /tmp/jupyterhub/bin/activate
pip install jupyterhub==5.2.1 swmjupyter
```

3. Generate default JupyterHub configuration:
```bash
jupyterhub --generate-config
```

4. Add Sky Port related settings to generated jupyterhub_config.py:
```
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'swmjupyter.spawner.SwmSpawner'
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'jupyterhub.auth.DummyAuthenticator'
c.SwmSpawner._swm_ca_file = '~/.swm/spool/secure/cluster/ca-chain-cert.pem'
c.SwmSpawner._swm_key_file = '~/.swm/key.pem'
c.SwmSpawner._swm_cert_file = '~/.swm/cert.pem'
c.SwmSpawner.start_timeout = 1800
```

4. Start JupyterHub:
```bash
jupyterhub
```

5. Submit Sky Port job:
a. go to `http://localhost:8000` in a web browser,
b. select notebook and other files that will be uploaded (if needed),
c. select flavor for VM machine (or use name filter if needed),
d. click "Start" button.

In 10-15 minutes JupyterLab will be started in Azure.
